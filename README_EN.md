## 🎮 What is Zomboid Builds?

Zomboid Builds is a web application that simplifies the character creation process in Project Zomboid. Instead of using the game's interface, players can:

- **Select professions** with their base skills
- **Choose positive and negative traits** with an intelligent compatibility system
- **View final skills** calculated automatically
- **Save and share builds** for later use or with other players
- **Generate random builds** to experiment with different combinations

- **Game modes**: Support for Single Player and Multiplayer with specific restrictions

### 💾 Persistence and Sharing
- **Auto-save**: Persistent state in localStorage
- **Shareable URLs**: Generate links to share builds
- **Build management**: Save, load and delete custom builds
- **PDF export**: Generate professional build reports

### 🎵 User Experience
- **Audio system**: Sound effects and background music
- **Responsive interface**: Optimized for mobile and desktop
- **Internationalization**: Complete support in Spanish and English
- **Modern design**: Clean and intuitive UI with Tailwind CSS

### 🔧 Technical Architecture
